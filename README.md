# nx-simple

An Nx plugin that helps you fall into the pit of success.

## Executors

### [nx-simple:build â†’](./src/executors/build/README.md)

> Compiles and packages TypeScript projects for internal use within a monorepo.

### [nx-simple:package â†’](./src/executors/package/README.md)

> Compiles and packages TypeScript projects for publication to NPM, deployment as an app, or inclusion within another packagable project.

## Principles

The plugin aims to achieve a predictable and cohesive development experience by adhering to the following design principles:

1. Compatibility with other tools in the ecosystem
1. Transparency about what is happening under-the-hood
1. Implicit contracts are identified and clearly documented
1. Any combination of options provide a working state
1. Well-defined goals can be achieved using a "strategy" option, which encapsulates a set of functions

## Contracts

Each executor declares any contracts that need to be fulfiled by the user for it to work.

The plugin, globally, expects the following contracts to be fulfilled:

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Nx is configured to analyse source files</strong></summary>
<br />

**Why?** When using a single-version policy (i.e. dependencies are declared in root package.json), Nx needs to be configured to detect dependencies within modules.

**How?** Enable the `analyzeSourceFiles`. Unless you have a Lerna repo, this will be on by default.

```jsonc
// nx.json
{
  "pluginsConfig": {
    "@nrwl/js": {
      "analyzeSourceFiles": true
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Compatibility

nx-simple aims to maximise compatability with other tools in the ecosystem. This table provides an overview of how and why compatability is achieved.

| Tooling                                             | Setup                                                                       | Explanation                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ðŸŸ¢ **Build tools** (ts-node, esbuild, webpack etc.) | [build executor](./src/executors/build/README.md#contracts) contract #1     | Build tools will resolve the package to the compiled code without the need for any custom path mappings                |
| ðŸŸ¢ **Intellisense**                                 | [build executor](./src/executors/build/README.md#contracts) contract #2     | Imports are resolved to their source files when using features like "Go to definition"                                 |
| ðŸŸ¢ **Single-version monorepos**                     | [package executor](./src/executors/package/README.md#contracts) contract #3 | A separate package is built with a generated package.json (including any detected dependencies)                        |
| ðŸŸ  **Publishing/versioning tools<sup>1</sup>**      | [package executor](./src/executors/package/README.md)                       | Versioning is applied to source packages as normal. Only packages built to `{workspaceRoot}/dist` should be published. |

#### Caveats

1. Publishing tools generally assume that the package they version-bump is also the package to be released. The workflow with Nx plugins is slightly different: the source package should be version-bumped, and the built package (in `{workspaceRoot}/dist/{projectName}` should be published.

## Q&A

#### Why does the executor not bundle packages?

1. Now that ES modules are widely available, a good starting point is not to bundle
2. Bundling adds extra complexity, both in the implementation and for the user, when determining things like how to handle rewriting import.meta.url
3. There are great tools out there for bundling when it's required, and the packages that the [build executor](./src/executors/build/README.md) produces can be consumed by bundlers just as they would consume any regular package in node_modules

## Roadmap

- Error if project does not have a package.json
- Multiple entry points
- Accept compatible SWC options https://swc.rs/docs/usage/cli#options
- Accept option to specify what to do with non-publishable dependencies â€“Â error, skip, package by extending nx-simple:build, look for built modules in some search paths
