# nx-simple

An Nx plugin that helps you fall into the pit of success.

## Principles

The plugin aims to achieve a predictable and cohesive development experience by adhering to the following design principles:

1. Compatibility with other tools in the ecosystem
1. Transparency about what is happening under-the-hood
1. Implicit contracts (conventions) are identified and clearly documented
1. Any combination of options provide a working state
1. Well-defined goals can be achieved using a "strategy" option, which encapsulates a set of functions

# Executors

## build-esm

Builds TypeScript ESM packages. The executor creates builds for internal use within a monorepo, or for publication to an NPM registry.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This executor does not bundle modules. Although there are use-cases for bundling, both for browsers and node.js, doing so means either not getting access to all ES module features (e.g. `import.meta`), or setting up extra transpilation steps, which is out-of-scope for this executor.

### Usage

```jsonc
// package.json (see conventions)
{
  "name": "my-package",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "path/to/entry.ts"
}
```

```jsonc
// project.json (see options)
{
  "targets": {
    "build": {
      "executor": "nx-simple:build-esm",
      "options": {
        "distribution": "internal"
      }
    },
    "prepublish": {
      "executor": "nx-simple:build-esm",
      "options": {
        "distribution": "external"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Options

| Param           | Type                         | Default    | Description                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `distribution`  | `"internal" \| "external"`   | required   | the distribution strategy             |
| `entry`         | `string`                     | `index.ts` | the package's entry module            |
| `assets`        | `string[]`                   | `[]`       | any files to copy to the build folder |
| `targetRuntime` | `"es5" \| "es6" \| "esYYYY"` | `es2020`   | the target JavaScript environment     |

### Effects

- The parent directory of `entry` is considered the source directory. All TypeScript files under this directory will be compiled.
- If present, the SWC compiler will use `{projectRoot}.swcrc` as its base config
- TODO: creates path mappings based on tsconfig baseUrl & paths

#### `distribution: internal`

- Compiles a buildable package to `{projectRoot}/dist`
- Compiles all modules within the `entry` module's directory e.g if `entry` is `src/index.ts` then all modules inside `src` will be compiled
- Generates source maps

#### `distribution: external`

- Compiles a publishable package to `{workspaceRoot}/dist/{projectName}`
- Compiles ESM and CJS versions of the source modules
- Generates a `package.json`
- Adds detected dependencies to `package.json`
- Adds `main` and `module` fields to `package.json`
- Copies any README, LICENSE, LICENCE files
- Type checks project using nearest `tsconfig.json`
- Type checks any included packages
- Generates type definition (`.d.ts`) files
- WIP: Detects, packages and includes non-publishable dependencies

### Conventions

<details>
<summary><strong>1. The package is an NPM workspace</strong></summary>
<br />

> **Why?** Allow the package to be imported by its package name, and resolvable by any tool in the ecosystem.

> **How?** In the root `package.json`, include the package within the `workspaces` field.

```jsonc
// root package.json
{
  "workspaces": ["pacakges/**"],
  "workspaces": ["pacakges/package-a"]
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>2. The `types` field points to the entry module</strong></summary>
<br />

> **Why?** In development, features like "Go to definition" should navigate to source files, not the compiled output.

> **How?** Set `types` to the entry module. Note: this works even if it's a regular TypeScript file! Publishable packages (built using the `external` strategy) will have this field replaced with the path of the generated `.d.ts` file).

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "types": "src/index.ts",
  "types": "index.ts" // if this is your entry module in here, you can just omit this field
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>3. The `main` field points to the dist folder</strong></summary>
<br />

> **Why?** Build tools that encounter this package should resolve imports to the compiled code.

> **How?** Set `main` to `dist/${entryModuleName}.js`. Note: the path to the entry module filename is not required.

```jsonc
// project.json
{
  "targets": {
    "build": {
      "executor": "nx-simple:build-esm",
      "options": {
        "entry": "src/index.ts"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "main": "dist/index.js"
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>4. The `type` field is `module`</strong></summary>
<br />

> **Why?** Using ESM comes with a set of caveats; interoperating between ESM and CJS can get quite complicated. To keep things simple, this executor focuses just on ESM packages.

> How? Set `type` to `module`

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>5. Nx `inputs` and `outputs` are set</strong></summary>
<br />

> **Why?** Nx needs to know where different executors write their artefacts.

> **How?** Assuming internal packages are created using a `build` target, and external using a `prepublish` target, you would need the following configuration:

```jsonc
// nx.json
{
  "namedInputs": {
    "default": ["{projectRoot}/**/*"]
  },
  "targetDefaults": {
    "build": {
      "inputs": ["default", "^default"],
      "outputs": ["{projectRoot}/dist"],
      "dependsOn": ["^build"]
    },
    "prepublish": {
      "inputs": ["default", "^default"],
      "outputs": ["{workspaceRoot}/dist"]
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>6. Nx is configured to analyse source files</strong></summary>
<br />

> **Why?** When using both a single-version policy, and creating external packages, Nx needs configured to detect dependencies within modules.

> **How?** Enable the `analyzeSourceFiles`.

```jsonc
// nx.json
{
  "pluginsConfig": {
    "@nrwl/js": {
      "analyzeSourceFiles": true
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

### Compatibility

| Tooling                                             | Setup                               | Explanation                                                                                                            |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üü¢ **Build tools** (ts-node, esbuild, webpack etc.) | convention 1, internal distribution | Build tools will resolve the package to the compiled code without the need for any custom path mappings                |
| üü¢ **Intellisense**                                 | convention 2                        | Imports are resolved to their source files when using features like "Go to definition"                                 |
| üü¢ **Single-version monorepos**                     | convention 3, external distribution | A separate package is built with a generated package.json (including any detected dependencies)                        |
| üü† **Publishing/versioning tools**                  | external distribution               | Versioning is applied to source packages as normal. Only packages built to `{workspaceRoot}/dist` should be published. |

#### Caveats

- Publishing tools will probably assume that the package they version-bump is also the package to be released. This is an unavoidable consequence of this plugin's setup (to avoid package.json conflicts, the executor builds the publishable package to `{workspaceRoot}/dist`).
